    "You're currently a data scientist working at a university. A professor of psychology is attempting to study the relationship between personalities and left-handedness. They have tasked you with gathering evidence so that they may publish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, the professor says \"I need to prove that left-handedness is caused by some personality trait. Go find that personality trait and the data to back it up.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "As a data scientist, you know that any real data science problem must be **specific** and **conclusively answerable**. For example:\n",
    "- Bad data science problem: \"What is the link between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is vague and is not conclusively answerable. That is, two people might look at the conclusion and one may say \"Sure, the problem has been answered!\" and the other may say \"The problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Good data science problem: \"Does an association exist between obesity and blood pressure?\"\n",
    "    - This is more specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically is asking for a \"Yes\" or \"No\" answer. Based on that, two independent people should both be able to say either \"Yes, the problem has been answered\" or \"No, the problem has not yet been answered.\"\n",
    "- Excellent data science problem: \"As obesity increases, how does blood pressure change?\"\n",
    "    - This is very specific and is conclusively answerable. The problem specifically seeks to understand the effect of one variable on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. In the context of the left-handedness and personality example, what are three specific and conclusively answerable problems that you could answer using data science? \n",
